## Phlox Worlds

On Phlox we have 6 worlds in total: the overworld, end and nether and their resource world variants. The point of having resource worlds is so our players can freely collect resources without worrying about the main world getting destroyed.

Keep in mind when RTPing around the worlds: 
The resource worlds get **reset every 5-7 days**, and your builds will **NOT** be saved in them!
